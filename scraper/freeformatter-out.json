In 1999, she was first assigned to the Astronaut Office International Space Station Operations branch as a Russian crusader, participating in the testing and integration of Russian hardware and software products developed for the International Space Station (ISS).  In 2000, she was assigned prime crew support astronaut for Expedition 5 to the ISS, serving as their representative on technical and operational issues throughout the training and in-orbit phase of their mission.  Caldwell Dyson has worked inside the Mission Control Center as spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for both space shuttle and space station operations, serving also as the lead CAPCOM for ISS Increment 11.  Other technical assignments included flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) and supporting shuttle launch and landing operations at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, Florida.  Upon returning from her station mission, Caldwell Dyson established and led a large, multidisciplinary troubleshooting team focused on improving stowage and cargo transfer processes aboard the ISS. During her two flights, Caldwell Dyson logged over 188 days in space, including more than 22 hours in three spacewalks.",
      "EXPERIENCE:": "  As an undergraduate researcher at CSU Fullerton, Caldwell Dyson designed, constructed and implemented electronics and hardware associated with a laser-ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometer for studying atmospherically relevant gas phase chemistry.  During that time she also worked as an electrician/inside wireman for her father’s electrical contracting company doing commercial and light industrial construction.  At UC Davis, Caldwell Dyson taught general chemistry laboratory and began her graduate research.  Her dissertation work focused on investigating molecular level surface reactivity and kinetics of metal surfaces using electron spectroscopy, laser desorption, and Fourier transform mass spectrometry techniques.  She also designed and built peripheral components for a variable temperature, ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system.  In 1997, she received the Camille and Henry Drefus Postdoctoral Fellowship in environmental science to study atmospheric chemistry at the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine).  There, she investigated reactivity and kinetics of atmospherically relevant systems using atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopies.  In addition, she developed methods of chemical ionization for spectral interpretation of trace compounds.  Caldwell Dyson has published and presented her work in numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.  She is a private pilot and conversational in American Sign Language (ASL) and Russian."

      "SPACE_FLIGHT_EXPERIENCE:": "  STS-125 Atlantis (May 11-24, 2009) was the fifth and final Hubble servicing mission.  The 19 year old telescope spent six days in the Shuttle’s cargo bay undergoing an overhaul conducted by four spacewalkers over five daily spacewalks, with the assistance of crewmates inside the Atlantis.  The space walkers overcame frozen bolts, stripped screws, and stuck handrails.  The refurbished Hubble Telescope now has four new or rejuvenated scientific instruments, new batteries, new gyroscopes, and a new computer.  The STS-125 mission was accomplished in 12 days,  21 hours, 37 minutes and 09 seconds,  traveling 5,276,000 miles in 197 Earth orbits.",

      "NASA_EXPERIENCE:": "  Selected as a mission specialist by NASA in July 2000, McArthur reported for training in August 2000.  Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned to the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations Branch working technical issues on shuttle systems in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). McArthur then served as the Crew Support Astronaut for the Expedition 9 Crew during their six-month mission aboard the International Space Station.  She also worked in the Space Station and Space Shuttle Mission Control Centers as a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM).  McArthur served aboard STS-125, the final Space Shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. The mission successfully extended  and improved the observatory’s capabilities through 2014.  In completing her first space mission, McArthur has logged almost 13 days in space.",
      "EXPERIENCE:": "  At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, McArthur conducted graduate research in nearshore underwater acoustic propagation and digital signal processing.  Her research focused on determining geoacoustic models to describe very shallow water waveguides using measured transmission loss data in a genetic algorithm inversion technique.  She served as Chief Scientist during at-sea data collection operations, and has planned and led diving operations during sea-floor instrument deployments and sediment-sample collections.  While at Scripps, she participated in a range of in-water instrument testing, deployment, maintenance and recovery, and collection of marine plants, animals, and sediment.  During this time, McArthur also volunteered at the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, conducting educational demonstrations for the public from inside a 70,000 gallon exhibit tank of the California Kelp Forest."

      "EXPERIENCE:": "    Love  worked summers at the University of Oregon in Eugene  as a computer programming instructor (1984) and as an assistant in physics and  chemistry laboratories (1985 to 1987).   As a graduate teaching assistant at the University  of Washington in Seattle, beginning in  1987, he taught undergraduate courses in general and planetary astronomy.  He worked as a graduate research assistant at  the University of Washington, 1989 to 1993, on a variety of projects including  space propulsion and energy storage, stellar photometry and spectroscopy,  analysis of space-exposed surfaces, hypervelocity impact and particle capture,  atmospheric entry heating of micrometeoroids, infrared imaging of the zodiacal  light and electron microscopy of interplanetary dust particles.  Love moved to the University of Hawaii in  Honolulu in 1994 for postdoctoral research on the formation of meteoritic  chondrules, the collisional evolution of asteroids and the possibility of  meteorites from the planet Mercury.  Love  was awarded a prize postdoctoral fellowship at the California Institute of  Technology in 1995.  His work there  included computational fluid dynamic simulations of asteroid collisions,  calibration of the Cassini spacecraft's dust-particle impact detector and experimental  shock compression of the mineral calcite.   Love transferred to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a staff engineer in  1997 to work on computer models and simulations of spacecraft optical  instrument systems and to participate in a laboratory-wide process  re-engineering effort.",
      "SPACEFLIGHT__EXPERIENCE: _": "  In 2008, Love  completed his first spaceflight on the crew of STS-122, logging more than 306  hours in space, including more than 15 hours in two spacewalks.  STS-122 Atlantis (February 7  through February 20, 2008) was the 24th shuttle  mission to visit the International Space Station.  The primary objective of the flight was to  carry the European Space Agency’s Columbus laboratory module to the space station  and install it there permanently.  Love  performed two spacewalks to help prepare the Columbus laboratory for  installation, to add two science payloads to the outside of Columbus and to  carry a failed ISS gyroscope to the shuttle for return to Earth.  Love's flight duties also included operation  of both the station and shuttle robotic arms.  STS-122 was a crew replacement mission,  delivering Expedition16 flight engineer, European Space Agency astronaut  Léopold Eyharts, and returning home with Expedition16 flight engineer, NASA astronaut  Daniel Tani.  The STS-122 mission was  accomplished in 12 days, 18 hours, 21 minutes and 40 seconds and traveled  5,296,832 statute miles in 203 Earth orbits.
