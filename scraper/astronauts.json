STS-45 (March 24 to April 2, 1992) was the first of the ATLAS series of missions to study the atmosphere and solar interactions.  STS-56 (April 9 to April 17, 1993) carried ATLAS-2 and the SPARTAN retrievable satellite that made observations of the solar corona.  STS-63 (February 2 to February 11, 1995) was the first rendezvous with the Russian Space Station Mir.  During STS-63, Dr. Foale made his first space walk (EVA) with Bernard Harris for 4 hours, 39 minutes, evaluating extremely cold spacesuit conditions, and exploring mass handling of the 2800-pound Spartan satellite.  His next flight was aboard the Russian Space Station Mir, launched on STS-84 on May 15, 1997 to join the Mir 23 crew.  Initially, Foale conducted science experiments, but then helped reestablish the Mir after it was degraded by a collision and depressurization.  He conducted a 6-hour EVA in the Russian Orlan spacesuit with Anatoli Soloviev to inspect damage to the station's Spektr module caused by a collision of a Progress resupply ship.  Foale returned to Earth on STS-86, October 6, 1997, having spent 145 days in space.  From December 19 to December 27, 1999 he flew on STS-103, an 8-day mission, to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope.  During an 8-hour and 10-minute EVA, Foale and Claude Nicollier replaced the telescope\u2019s main computer and Fine Guidance Sensor.

During the mission, the crew successfully added truss segment S5 and a new gyroscope.  As a mission specialist, Caldwell Dyson assisted in flight deck operations on ascent and also aided in rendezvous/docking operations with the ISS.  Caldwell Dyson operated Endeavour\u2019s robotic arm to maneuver the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) and handover the S5 truss segment to the space station, and served as the intravehicular  (IV) crew member, directing the four spacewalks.

In 1999, she was first assigned to the Astronaut Office International Space Station Operations branch as a Russian crusader, participating in the testing and integration of Russian hardware and software products developed for the International Space Station (ISS).  In 2000, she was assigned prime crew support astronaut for Expedition 5 to the ISS, serving as their representative on technical and operational issues throughout the training and in-orbit phase of their mission.  Caldwell Dyson has worked inside the Mission Control Center as spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for both space shuttle and space station operations, serving also as the lead CAPCOM for ISS Increment 11.  Other technical assignments included flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) and supporting shuttle launch and landing operations at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, Florida.  Upon returning from her station mission, Caldwell Dyson established and led a large, multidisciplinary troubleshooting team focused on improving stowage and cargo transfer processes aboard the ISS. During her two flights, Caldwell Dyson logged over 188 days in space, including more than 22 hours in three spacewalks.", "EXPERIENCE:": " \u00a0As an undergraduate researcher at CSU Fullerton, Caldwell Dyson designed, constructed and implemented electronics and hardware associated with a laser-ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometer for studying atmospherically relevant gas phase chemistry.  During that time she also worked as an electrician/inside wireman for her father\u2019s electrical contracting company doing commercial and light industrial construction.  At UC Davis, Caldwell Dyson taught general chemistry laboratory and began her graduate research.  Her dissertation work focused on investigating molecular level surface reactivity and kinetics of metal surfaces using electron spectroscopy, laser desorption, and Fourier transform mass spectrometry techniques.  She also designed and built peripheral components for a variable temperature, ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy system.  In 1997, she received the Camille and Henry Drefus Postdoctoral Fellowship in environmental science to study atmospheric chemistry at the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine).  There, she investigated reactivity and kinetics of atmospherically relevant systems using atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopies.  In addition, she developed methods of chemical ionization for spectral interpretation of trace compounds.  Caldwell Dyson has published and presented her work in numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.  She is a private pilot and conversational in American Sign Language (ASL) and Russian."}, {"name": "Epps,\n                                      Jeanette J.", "title":

McArthur then served as the Crew Support Astronaut for the Expedition 9 Crew during their six-month mission aboard the International Space Station.  She also worked in the Space Station and Space Shuttle Mission Control Centers as a Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM).  McArthur served aboard STS-125, the final Space Shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. The mission successfully extended  and improved the observatory\u2019s capabilities through 2014.  In completing her first space mission, McArthur has logged almost 13 days in space.", "EXPERIENCE:": "  At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, McArthur conducted graduate research in nearshore underwater acoustic propagation and digital signal processing.  Her research focused on determining geoacoustic models to describe very shallow water waveguides using measured transmission loss data in a genetic algorithm inversion technique.  She served as Chief Scientist during at-sea data collection operations, and has planned and led diving operations during sea-floor instrument deployments and sediment-sample collections.  While at Scripps, she participated in a range of in-water instrument testing, deployment, maintenance and recovery, and collection of marine plants, animals, and sediment.  During this time, McArthur also volunteered at the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, conducting educational demonstrations for the public from inside a 70,000 gallon exhibit tank of the California Kelp

He completed one year of training and is qualified for flight selection as a mission specialist.  Dr. Grunsfeld was initially detailed to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch and was assigned as the lead for portable computers for use in space.  Following his first flight, he led a team of engineers and computer programmers tasked with defining and producing the crew displays for command and control of the International Space Station (ISS).  As part of this activity, he directed an effort combining the resources of the Mission Control Center (MCC) Display Team and the Space Station Training Facility.  The result was the creation of the Common Display Development Facility (CDDF), which is responsible for the onboard and MCC displays for the ISS, using object-oriented programming techniques.  Following his second flight, he was assigned as Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office, supporting the Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs and advanced technology development.  Following STS-103, he served as Chief of the Extravehicular Activity Branch in the Astronaut Office.  Following STS-109, Grunsfeld served as an instructor in the Extravehicular Activity Branch and Robotics Branch and worked on the exploration concepts and technologies for use beyond low Earth orbit in the Advanced Programs Branch.  He also served as the NASA Chief Scientist detailed to NASA Headquarters from 2003 to 2004, where he helped develop the President's Vision for Space Exploration.  A veteran of five spaceflights, STS-67 (1995), STS-81 (1997), STS-103 (1999) STS-109 (2002) and STS-125 (2009), Dr. Grunsfeld has logged more than 58 days in space, including 58 hours and 30 minutes of EVA in 8 spacewalks.  Dr. Grunsfeld retired from NASA in December 2009 and served as Deputy Director, Space Telescope Science Institute, in Baltimore, Maryland.  He returned to NASA in January 2012 to serve as the Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington.", "EXPERIENCE:": "  Dr. Grunsfeld's academic positions include that of Visiting Scientist, University of Tokyo/Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (1980 to 1981); Graduate Research Assistant, University of Chicago (1981 to 1985); NASA Graduate Student Fellow, University of Chicago (1985 to 1987); W.D.
